# Cool Logger

## Introduction
A simple logger lib for c. 
Use The Makros CLOGx to log data like printf. For logging an array use CLOG_ARRAY.
To configure the library use the logger_conf.h

## Future Tasks
- implement more configurations
- improvements for embedded logging by reducing memory (snprintf uses a lot of memory)
- better configuration checks in logger_config_check
- adding tests
